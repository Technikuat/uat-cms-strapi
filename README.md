# Docker
We use docker-compose file for system configuration -> https://docs.docker.com
We can use following commands:
docker-compose down - to terminate all containers
docker-compose up -d - to build and run all containers
docker ps - to check container's status
docker stop CONTAINER_NAME - to stop specified container
docker rm CONTAINER_NAME - to remove container
docker rmi IMAGE_NAME - re remove image

We also use treafik as loadbalancer -> https://traefik.io
